# DM Table

DM Table is not a real plugin, but a PHP class for creating tables. It is a table generator, customizable and suitable for any PHP project. Being a generic class, it is cross-script, so it can be adapted and used on different types of content platform (CMS).

However, the package also includes DM_Table_WP, which is a class prepared specifically for WordPress. DM_Table WP is not an extension of DM_Table, but uses a DM_Table instance.
